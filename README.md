# UU fagkveld

Welcome to UU fagkveld. Read the whole readme file before you start!

We have made an example site containing multiple WCAG 2.0 errors, some technical, and some related to content. Your job is to catch them all!

You have one hour to complete this mission, and by the end you should have fixed the issues in the index.html file. For every issue you find, describe what you did to fix it with a short sentence.
When the time is up we will post to the slack channel on how you deliver your work. Remember:

- Fixed files
- Notes on what you fixed and how

If you have any questions, please ask them here: [#kxo-fagkveld-universell-utforming](slack://channel?team=T11FM77H8&id=C03ERGYAMGR)

## How to get started?

To see the example page navigate to:

[UU test site](https://draape.github.io/uu-fagkveld)

First, clone the project.

To run the page locally you can install `http-server` using

```
npm install http-server -g
```

Then navigate to the folder with the `index.html` file and run

```
http-server
```
